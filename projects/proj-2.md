title: 'Incremental ConvexHull Algorithm'
---

#### My Contribution Highlights
* Implemented and licensed an C++ incremental convexhull algorithm from chapter 4 of [Computational Geometry in C by O'Rourke](http://crtl-i.com/PDF/comp_c.pdf)
* Implemented ROS demonstration code for easy robot integration

#### More About the Project
This project was developed to support an underground robot explortation work. The convexhulls were used to represent collision-free space in registered LIDAR pointclouds. I have implmented the convexhull algorithm with a class of easy-to-use API, that would support any vector of objects with xyz fields.
