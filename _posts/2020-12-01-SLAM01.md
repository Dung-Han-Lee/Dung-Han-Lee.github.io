### Inference: SLAM as a Maximum A Posterior Problem

### Bayesian Equation
Consider the following example, because of the conditional independance of measurements given theta, the formula (1) can be broke down into the formula (2)

### Least Square

Note that we did **not** solved Ax=b, in general no exact solution because of noise, instead we solved argmin (Ax-b)^2 

### Linear Example

Note that the smaller the variance, the larger the coefficient, which would influence the solution more
