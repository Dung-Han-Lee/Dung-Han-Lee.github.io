### Lie Algebra, Jacobian and Kalman Filter
Recall in KF we have X = AX + BU. If we instead represent the 6DoF state vector using Lie algebra, then the question of which jacobian do we propagate uncertainty naturally arises. There are multiple blocks in jacobian that relates different state variables, e.g. R\_t and R\_t-1 or R\_t and w\_t-1. Here R, w represents SO(3) and angular velocity respectively.

To answer some of these questions, it's necessary to introduce the concept of adjoint

### Jacobian block for jac_R_w, jac_t_w, jac_R_v and jac_t_v

since R2 = exp(w) R1 (here w is a se(3)), diff(R2) = diff(exp(w)) R1
