title: "ORB Feature"

### Properties of Features
1. Repeatability: same region found in different images
2. Distinctiveness: distinguish different regions from one another
3. Efficiency: feature points should be much less than num of image pixels
4. Locality: only associate with local patch

### Fast Key Points
A corner dectector: examines whether 12 consecutive points out of 16 points are brighter or dimmer than the reference pixel. More [details](https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-fast-features-from-accelerated-segment-test-4ed33dde6d65). Since this feature often aggregates locally, non-maximal suppression is applied. In the original paper, the summation of intensity difference between reference point and query point is used. Wheares in the ORB, [harris corner](https://medium.com/data-breach/introduction-to-harris-corner-detector-32a88850b3f6) filter is applied to reject edges.

#### Harris Corner
It's desired that sum squared difference is large in all directions i.e. eigenvalue lambda 1 is roughly the same as lambda 2 for SSD distribution function. In the below equation, large R value is desirable rather than small (flat) or negative (edge).

### BRIEF Feature and Hanning Distance
BRIEF is a probablistic descriptor of a local patch, which randomly samples N pairs of (xi, yi) and (xj, yj) to compute a N bit descriptor with 1 indicates the former has larger intensity. Two descriptors are compared using hamming distance, which is minimum steps needed to transform from 1 string to the other. For non-matching sequences, the distribution would look like a gaussian center at 128 (random guess).

### Oriented BREIF
BREIF has no rotational nor multi-scale invariance, to resolve this, orientation is computed from intensity centroid, and an image pyramid is applied. It's interesting that orienting the feature to same direction actually damage the performance a lot -- obviously the performance depends on random orientation of a feature. To recover this performance drop, a learning-based approach is adopted on pascal test patches to obtain good samples that could generate uncorrelated, high-variance descriptors i.e. descriptor of high discriminating power.

### Remarks
1. outdoor environment with varying light conditions can still pose challenge to low level descriptors like ORB, since it's operating on per-pixel level after all. 
2. environment of repeative texture can be problematic as well
3. it still surprise me that BREIF feature actually works: the order and distribution of the sampling could be very different for the same patch, but somehow such random sampling captures some underlying patterns that allow a feature to distinguish from one another. ORB makes more sense to me since it learnt a specific 256 pairs of samples which would be applied to all features.
