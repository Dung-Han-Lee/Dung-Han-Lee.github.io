### OVERVIEW
KMeans is a heuristic and unsupervised method that guarantee to converge to an (local) optimal solution, since each iteration must reduce the WCSS (within-cluster sum of squares), and there's only finite number of assignments, the algorithm is gauaranteed to converge on an (local) optimal solution.

### Application in Bag of Words
K means can be used for image segmentation, specifically, cluster the response of different filters into K clusters, that can be used to assign each pixel in the map to the nearest cluster. The result could be further used to generate feature vecotr and classify images.

### Remarks
Despite being fast, K mean clustering has quite a few drawbacks:
1. K means needs to determine K before hand, the true number may never be known
2. Sensitive to outliers: the centroid can be pulled significantly due to one single noisy data point
3. Since euclidean distance metric is used in the formula, it assume a sphere like distribution
4. It assume each cluser should be equally large, in fact, the algorithm is equivalent to assigning points by Vornoi diagram of cluster centroids

EM algorithm could be used to yield better results.
