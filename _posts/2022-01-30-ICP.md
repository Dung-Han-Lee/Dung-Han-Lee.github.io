### Point-to-Point Metric (with Known Data Association)
A direct, optimal R exists for this formulation. Note the objective function is different from general Ax=b formulation but instead argmax(tr(RH)). By exploiting the orthnomal matrices U, V from SVD decomposition of H, the optimal R can be constrcuted as VU' if det(VU') equals to 1 i.e. VU' is an element of SO3. The paper argued that det(VU') equals to -1 iff noise is large. In an event where data association is unknown, points can be associated(guessed) using projective method etc as shown in kinect fusion.

### Point-to-Plane Metric
Normal-based methods often converges faster and were adopted more widely in practice. But such formulation (along with other more generic error metrics) has no direct, optimal solution. It could still be solved using iterative methods such as Gaussian Newton: linearing error func wrt SE3 lie algebra and construct the normal equation Ax=b by J'J delta\_x = J' err. Alternatively, small angle assumption can also be applied, with some re-arrangement of parameters to formulate the problem as Ax = b, where delta\_x is 6 DoF motion vectors.
